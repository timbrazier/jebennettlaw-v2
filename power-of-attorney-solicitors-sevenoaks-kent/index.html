      <p>JE Bennett Law offer a full range of advice to the elderly client, including Lasting Powers of Attorney; Wills; advice regarding care in the home, or the community; establishing what the Local Authority can or should be offering you; and how funding problems can be resolved whether it be via claims to the Local Authority or the NHS commissioning body, or both. Where necessary, we will also advise you on equity release schemes to the extent that there are implications regarding funding your current/future care. We can also advise you regarding the terms of your, or your loved one’s, care home contract.

      <h2 id="LPA">Lasting Power of Attorney</h2><p>
        If you need to give someone else the right  to make specific decisions on your behalf, you can use a legal device known as A Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). This replaced the Enduring Power of Attorney in 2007. There are two types. The appointed person can manage your property and finances for you and/or your health and welfare. These powers are transferred to the attorney in the future should you reach a point where you are no longer able to make decisions for yourself.
      </p>

        In addition, we offer advice on trusts for grandchildren as a tax-efficient vehicle to plan for the longer term, and where necessary we can act as certificate providers under Lasting Powers of Attorney. We will offer to review your Will where we may be working with you on other matters, as a matter of course.

          <strong>Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA)</strong> is the legal ability to manage someone's property and financial affairs on their behalf. It applies to people who do not have the mental capacity to decide on their financial matters, but must have been set up before they lost mental capacity. EPA’s were replaced by LPA’s in 2007. The most significant difference being that EPA’s did not cater for health and welfare decisions.
