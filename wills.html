      JE Bennett Law are a specialist vulnerable client law firm based in Sevenoaks and we are experts at creating and amending wills for our clients.      </p>
      </p>
      <div class="grey-paragraph">
        <p>People often shy away from making or updating their will. Thinking about what will happen when one dies can feel morbid but considering what will happen to one's estate upon death need not feel daunting and should just be treated as an exercise in planning for the future.       
          <br><br>
         If you die without leaving a valid will then your estate will pass in accordance with the rules of intestacy, and these rules set out the order of inheritance. In these circumstances it is not a ‘given’ that your spouse or civil partner or children will inherit and there is the risk that someone that you have no relationship or contact with, for example, could benefit from your estate. A will provides the opportunity to:

          <br>
       
<ul>
  <li>Choose who you want to act as executor and administer the estate for you</li>
<li>Name a guardian for any children under the age of 18</li>
<li>Leave gifts to specific individuals or organisations</li>
<li>Leave the remainder of your estate to whomever you wish</li>
<li>Leave assets in trust for young or vulnerable beneficiaries</li>
        <br><br>  
        It is possible to make a will without legal guidance but it is worth bearing in mind that complexity is down to individual circumstances and not always just the size and value of the estate. At JE Bennett Law we can add value to the will making process by explaining clearly the options available to you based on your own specific circumstances. We strongly advise you seek professional advice before making a will, to provide the peace of mind in knowing that your wishes will be adhered to.
