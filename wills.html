      JE Bennett Law are a specialist vulnerable client law firm based in Sevenoaks and we are experts at creating and amending wills for our clients.      </p>

      <div class="grey-paragraph">
        <p>People often shy away from making or updating wills. Thinking about what will happen to your estate can feel morbid and daunting... but it’s really essential that you go through the process and act on it. We all want to make sure our family and loved ones are cared for after our deaths and the best way to ensure this is to leave a will to avoid creating any additional stress at what will be a traumatic time for those we really care about. A will should obviously include details of your wishes for your funeral/resting place as well as your wishes for your assets/estate and any dependents.
                  
          <br><br>
          In terms of your estate, you might assume that your partner will receive everything, but that might not be the case, especially if you’re not married. Similarly, if you’ve divorced and remarried you can’t assume your estate will go to your children. Rules and regulations regarding inheritance can be complex, depending on your circumstances. 
        <br><br>
        You can make a will yourself without legal guidance. Or you can take the advice of experts like JE Bennett Law who really understand the law and can help you express your wishes in a clear and legally binding fashion. We strongly advise you seek advice and have the peace of mind of knowing that your wishes will be adhered to.
