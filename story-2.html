        In another case involving Miss B, a former deputyship client of the firm, Jane worked with the young lady concerned, again a victim of a serious road traffic accident resulting in a very serious brain injury, to enable and empower her to resume control over her own finances in time.

        Miss B is happy to say that: <i>"Jane and her team helped me to move towards taking control of my own money and Jane acts as a professional trustee regarding my compensation monies. Her support and encouragement, together with that of my family has encouraged me to enjoy my own independence again, in a way which I never thought possible in the early days after my accident.  I know that I have the safety net of my own personal trust which now houses my settlement monies, and Jane and her team’s counsel whenever I should need it."</i>
