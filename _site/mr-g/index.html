        JE Bennett Law handled work relating to difficulties Mr G was having with the local council to secure specialist support services for his son who has learning difficulties, Autism and an Acquired Brain Injury.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr G said of Janeâ€™s input: <i>"From start to finish I felt my case was being handled by someone who had a complete grasp of the difficulties I had been experiencing and that person had the depth of knowledge and experience to manage my expectations regarding possible outcomes. Jane Bennett's strength is undoubtedly her calming, understanding and reassuring manner. Contact with Jane was both simple and without delay. I felt at all times I was being listened to and managing my individual case was as equally as important to her as well as to me. My total experience was one of great satisfaction and I honestly struggle to highlight any weakness.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Albeit I only made contact with Jane Bennett and occasionally with her secretary, I gained the impression the whole team were not only professional as one would expect but actually do sincerely care about making a difference for those they are representing. The JE Bennett Law website is testimony to that with real life examples from past clients helping to reassure me I was engaging with a firm who specialised and had vast experience in dealing with vulnerable people. Profiles of all within the firm further convinced me I could trust making contact and indeed committing financially for their services. It was made clear what financial commitment I would be undertaking and just what I was getting for my money. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I cannot put a price on the emotional and physical benefits my whole family have been afforded following a successful outcome to my case and therefore my financial outlay undoubtedly was value for money.  "</i>
