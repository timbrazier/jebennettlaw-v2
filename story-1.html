        Jane acts as deputy for Mr F who sustained a catastrophic brain injury in a road traffic accident some years ago.  He was awarded a compensation settlement in a reported case valued in excess of £17,000,000.  Jane’s input as professional deputy for Mr F’s property and affairs was commended by the judge who heard the case in the High Court, for the careful and measured manner in which her evidence was given in respect of her role as professional deputy, and the costs involved in running the deputyship, and awarded that the deputyship costs would form a discrete part of the annual sum awarded to meet his needs.

        Mr F’s care needs are a constant challenge and Jane and her team have worked tirelessly over the years to source the right care and maintain appropriate therapeutic input and Mr F’s involvement in decisions being made on his behalf.  Being a young man, Mr F has continually wanted to express his own wishes and make as many decisions as possible for himself.  The team is committed to honouring this and ensuring that Mr F’s quality of life is enhanced wherever possible.
      </p>

        Mr F’s family have been grateful for Jane and the team’s input, stating that, <i>"We have worked with JE Bennett Law for five years and found their services to be very professional, knowledgeable and in tune with our requirements. Overall, I would recommend JE Bennett Law with all court of protection issues."</i>

        One of the defendant insurers in the case went on to recommend Jane’s expert witness services in respect of professional deputyship costings in other cases.
