        Jane Bennett, is a member of the Office of the Public Guardian’s national panel of professional deputies and is regularly appointed by the Court of Protection in circumstances where vulnerable people require representation in order to manage their property and affairs and their care and welfare. This could be due to a brain injury; illness; clinical negligence or age-related issues. 
             <br><br>
         In addition to acting as a professional deputy, we also advise lay deputies to ensure every aspect of the vulnerable person’s needs are appropriately managed.
