      <h2 id="LPA">Lasting Power of Attorney</h2><p>
        According to the Alzheimer's Society by 2025, 1 million people in the UK will have dementia and currently 1 in 5 people over the age of 85 are affected. It's never been more important to plan for the future to ensure your affairs are managed as you'd like them to be, should the time come where you lack the capacity to make those decisions yourself. It's not just the elderly who need to plan ahead, incapacity can strike the younger generation's through injury or illness too. </p>
    <p>If you need to give someone else the right to make specific decisions on your behalf, you can use a legal device known as a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). This replaced the Enduring Power of Attorney in 2007. There are two types. The appointed person can manage your property and finances for you and/or your health and welfare. These powers are transferred to the attorney in the future should you reach a point where you are no longer able to make decisions for yourself.

        JE Bennett Law, are vulnerable clinet specialists, and we regularly deal with difficult circumstances regarding clients and their families and we witness the stress this can cause to all involved. We strongly recommend people take out a Lasting Power of Attorney for the peace of mind it provides to all involved. You do not need to take legal advice to give Power of Attorney, forms are available from the Office of the Public Guardian, but if you want advice on the process and to ensure that your intentions are laid out in a legally binding manner, we are here to help and act as certificate providers (it's a requirement that someone certifies that you have entered into the LPA voluntarily and that you understand what you are doing) under Lasting Powers of Attorney if you wish. As a matter of course, we will offer to review your Will where we may be working with you on other matters, as a matter of course.

          <strong>Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA)</strong> is the legal ability to manage someone's property and financial affairs on their behalf. It applies to people who do not have the mental capacity to decide on their financial matters, but must have been set up before they lost mental capacity. EPA’s were replaced by LPA’s in 2007. The most significant difference being that EPA’s did not cater for health and welfare decisions.
