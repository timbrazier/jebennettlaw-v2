    Our core specialism consists in the provision of truly independent professional deputyship services under the Court of Protection, and advice to lay deputies, together with professional trustee services (both within and outside of the Court of Protection).  Flowing neatly on from that, we advise on all possible types of application to the Court of Protection including regarding gifts and transfers; the impact and implications of lack of capacity regarding other types of legal proceedings; Wills, including tax-efficient Wills; Wills catering for disabled beneficiaries; Statutory Wills for those who lack mental capacity to make a Will; Probate, and the whole gamut of elderly client law, including powers of attorney; Advance Directives (or the so-called living Wills), and access to local care in the community services via the NHS and the local authority.
