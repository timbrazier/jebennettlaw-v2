        Jane advised a lay deputy regarding his brother’s brain injury insurance settlement monies, having successfully applied to the Court of Protection for approval of a personal injury trust. Being retained on an ongoing basis in respect of his brother’s ancillary relief proceedings through the Family Courts, Jane worked with the lay deputy, legal Counsel in the family proceedings and the solicitor acting for the brain injured client in the financial proceedings relating to his divorce. We ensured that as a team, the best possible result could be achieved for the client taking all the Court of Protection angles into account to maximise his position.

        Mr P said of Jane’s input: <i>"Jane has assisted our family over the last three years regarding our brain-injured family member's legal needs, ranging from assisting us with negotiations with the nhs commissioners for continuing care, which together we achieved, to a successful application to the court of protection regarding approval of a personal injury trust despite a deputyship already being in place, in what were exceptional circumstances.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Jane assisted us to get a handle on the subtleties, requirements and complexities of court of protection procedures, particularly where ancillary relief proceedings were also involved, arising out of our family member's divorce. Jane was also able to provide advice and guidance in gaining expert medical support where required for both the deputyship and ancillary relief proceeding requirements. This was always done with both empathy and professionalism.</i>
      </p>

        <i>We would not hesitate to recommend her and JE Bennett Law in future.""</i>
