        Jane is an expert of choice for the leading national road traffic insurer, Ageas, and acts in numerous cases for them and other leading insurer clients, by regularly receiving instructions to prepare expert witness statements regarding the role of a professional deputy and the associated costs, from a number of high profile defendant personal injury law firms.  Jane provides valuable input in relation to how to run a deputyship, drawing on her many years of experience in order to present sensible arguments as to how best to run the deputyship and balance the multifarious issues that can arise in valuing the cost of the deputyship in Court proceedings involving serious accidents resulting in head and other injuries.
